        <h1>Netscape Tales</h1>
        <p>"Netscape Tales" is an exhibition of internet artworks from the days of Netscape, pre 2000. 
            This exhibition serves to remind us, or introduce us, to the simpler and older times of
            website creation. We may be so used to the refined and polished websites of today, which 
            use HTML, CSS, and javscript, or any other combination of languages. But how far can we 
            go with a website just using pure HTML? The results may surprise you. These net artworks 
            take us back to these less complicated times and give us a breath of fresh air.

        <p>
            The File Room (1994) by Antoni Muntadas and collaborators is a net artwork that documents cases of censorship,
            so that such works aren't completely erased and are archived somewhere. Through navigating the website, users 
            are able to submit their own cases of censorship, thus adding onto the artwork themselves.

        <p>
          Form Art (1997) by Alexei Shulgin is a website that holds the submissions to a net artwork competition,
          in which users make artworks out of HTML form elements. The website itself also holds to that rule, with
          the main page itself being of buttons which leads to pages with buttons, textboxes, and checkboxes. 
          My favorite page of this website being of when some of buttons lead you to a game,
          also made up entirely of form elements, which I find to be very impressive and unique.

        <p>
            Communication Creates Conflict (1995) by Heath Bunting is a net artwork of which takes messages users 
            enter, and has it displayed through different ways, such as being on a sign in a public area, on a fax,
            or on a postcard. Due to the odd natre of random messages displayed in public areas, they can potentially 
            create interesting social situations, thus the title "Communication Creates Conflict." The main page greets
            you with a poem, of which some characters of the text are hyperlinked to another page in which the user is 
            taken to a submission form in which to submit the message, accompanied with an excerpt relating to the method 
            in which the user's message will be displayed.
