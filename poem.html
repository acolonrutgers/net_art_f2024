        <h3>This is a speculative thread.</h3>
        <hr>
            <p>However, community days for the next month are often revealed the week after the previous community day took place, so we should probably get our answer soon. <br><br> Regardless, I have a few reasons as to why I think next community day may be based around Yamask:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>This season is&nbsp;<b>Galar-related</b>, and during the Alola debut season, all of the community days were Alola-themed (Sandshrew, Stufful, and Alolan Geodude)</li>
                <li>Halloween is coming up. And oftentimes, October community days are ghost-focused (Duskull and Litwick being the most prominent examples).</li>
                <li>Yamask has become more common in this season as compared to previous seasons. 
                    <ol>
                        <li><em>While this doesn't guarantee a community day release,</em> there have been instances where a Pokemon appears more frequently in the wild during the season of its community day (Galarian Ponyta being the most recent example).</li>
                        <li>On the other hand, it could just be in preparation for Unova Tour, similar to how Delibird became available for a whole season as opposed to just during December, during the season of Johto tour.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
